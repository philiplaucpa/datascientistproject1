# AirBnB rental Analysis
I think everyone has heard fantastic opportunity for the AirBnB.  Different Investor propose where or what property is the best for AirBnB.  However, it is very difficult to distinguish which idea is legitimate or which idea is a gimmick.  Below is my research that answer three common questions people have related to AirBnb.  
1. Which price range perform the best given number of bedroom?
2. What is the optimized number of bedrooms for AirBnB?
3. Does CPI has correlation relationship Airbnb pric?

In this project, we will use mainly Boston's Airbnb data to answer the question.  For #3 question, we will be using the Seattle Airbnb data to do comparision.
